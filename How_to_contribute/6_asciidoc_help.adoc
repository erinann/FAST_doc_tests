These instructions are for people who have not used AsciiDoc markup before. +
*NOT a FIRST DRAFT!*

== Why a lightweight markup?
AsciiDoc is a lightweight markup language built around the idea that authors should spend their time writing, not messing around with finicky formatting issues. Simply put, writing in plain text syntax takes some of the frustration out of writing. When you do not have to worry about inconsistent formatting dilemmas that constantly creep into what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) editors like Microsoft Word or OpenDocs, writing is less distracting. One linespace will always be just one linespace. Also, plain text can easily be translated to different outputs (HTML, HTML5, PDF, etc.) for different applications. +

=== What is AsciiDoc?
[quote, https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/]
____
AsciiDoc is two things:

1. A mature, plain-text writing format for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, ebooks, web pages, slide decks, blog posts, man pages and more.

2. A text processor and toolchain for translating AsciiDoc documents into various formats (called backends), including HTML, DocBook, PDF and ePub.

=== Installing Asciidoctor
Do not. +

Unless you work in Ruby, like diving into the guts of your operating system, and you want to compile a backend on your machine, there is no need for you to install the Asciidoctor toolchain. The AsciiDoc extensions in Atom and Brackets work well to edit and preview the convention documents.

.Point of clarification
*_Asciidoctor_* is the processor and publishing toolchain for converting AsciiDoc files to HTML, PDF and other formats. *_AsciiDoc_* is the markup syntax. 

[TIP]
====
If you use Windows 10 and you want to install the Asciidoctor toolchain, initiate the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10[Windows Subsystem for Linux] (WSL) and install Ruby, Ruby Version Manager, and the Asciidoctor toolchain there.

The link:experienced_github_users.adoc[A quick workflow for experienced Git and GitHub users] document will get you started.

Will this render with a hard break?

But where does it stop?

== AsciiDoc vs. Markdown
Markdown is probably more familiar to many people, especially if you work in R and use RMarkdown. So, why are we using AsciiDoc instead of Markdown? Many or the formatting options in Markdown are the same or similar in AsciiDoc, but AsciiDoc syntax is more concise and it is more flexible when creating table of contents, lists, table, and admonitions (tip, notes, warnings, etc.).

This comparison table of AsciiDoc and Markdown syntax was recreated from   https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#comparison-by-example[1.5.3 Comparison by example] section of the Asciidoctor User Manual.

|===

{asterisk} Asciidoctor also supports the Markdown syntax for this language feature.

You can see that AsciiDoc has the following advantages over Markdown:

* AsciiDoc uses the same number of markup characters or less when compared to Markdown in nearly all cases.
* AsciiDoc uses a consistent formatting scheme (i.e., it has consistent patterns).
* AsciiDoc can handle all permutations of nested inline (and block) formatting, whereas Markdown often falls down.
* AsciiDoc handles cases that Markdown doesn't, such as a proper approach to inner-word markup, source code blocks and block-level images.
