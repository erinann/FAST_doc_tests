3. Go to your forked repository in GitHub and copy the HTTPS address to the clipboard to clone the repo. See <<2_suggested_workflow.adoc#Clone the forked repository to your local computer,Clone the forked repository to your local computer>> in the Suggested Workflow file.
4. In Atom, add the HTTPS address to "Clone from". +
Your user name will replace "erinann" in the GitHub address you add.
5. Add the full pathname to the directory where you want to your local repository to live. Make sure that the name of the final folder name is "wg_WGFAST". +
Note: There is no "Browse" option to add a full pathname. You have to type it in or copy and paste.
