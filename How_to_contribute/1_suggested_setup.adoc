These instructions are to help contributors who have not used Git, GitHub, or AsciiDoc markup get started.

If you have experience in Git and GitHub, skip the setup and workflow files and read through the link:experienced_github_users.adoc[A quick workflow for experienced Git and GitHub users].

There is a lot of jargon surrounding Git and GitHub, but that is normal in any specialized field. Try explaining what you do to a five year old without using the terms, "backscatter", "decibel", and "transducer". Thankfully, you do not need to be an expert in multiple programming languages or fields of computer science to contribute to the WGFAST convention documents. You only need to be the fisheries acoustic expert that you are and to understand a few core concepts of Git and GitHub. These documents are here to help you with the latter. +

== Software, accounts, and languages
=== Software to install
*Git* - A distributed version control system. +
*Atom* or **Brackets** - Text editors. If you prefer to work online, you will not need a text editor. However, we suggest using a text editor if you are going to do more than fix a few spelling errors. +

- _Atom_ is a text editor that works directly with GitHub upon installation. You as of this writing, you will still need to use Git to update your forked repository but other commands can be done within the Atom environment. You will have to install a few packages written for Atom to work with AsciiDoc documents. +
- _Brackets_ is a text editor that also works with Git and GitHub. You have to have Git installed, and you will have to install a few packages to preview AsciiDoc documents. +

=== Account to create
*GitHub* - A cloud-based hosting service used to manage Git repositories. +

=== Markup languages to learn (only a little)
*AsciiDoc* - extension `.adoc` +
AsciiDoc is a popular and flexible plain text markup language. Both convention documents are written in (or being translated to) AsciiDoc markup. GitHub automatically renders `.adoc` files (you are reading it now). +

*Markdown* - extension `.md` +
Markdown is the most popular plain text markup language but it is not as flexible as AsciiDoc. You will see a couple documents in the `wg_WGFAST` repository with `.md` extensions (eg - `README.md`). These are written in Markdown. GitHub automatically renders Markdown files.

Both Atom and Brackets support AsciiDoc and Markdown and provide live previews for each format. +

== Suggested order of setup
If you do not have any of the software or accounts listed in the section above, this is the most painless way to get started.

1. Create a GitHub account. See the link:3_github_help.adoc[GitHub Help] file.
2. Install Git. See the link:4_git_help.adoc[Git Help] file.
3. Install Atom or Brackets. Install the necessary packages to read `.adoc` and `.md` files, and link to Git and GitHub. Then, sign into your GitHub account through either text editor. See the link:plain_text_editor_help.adoc[Plain Text Editor Help] file.
4. Learn a little about AsciiDoc markup. See the link:asciidoc_help.adoc[AsciiDoc Help] file. +
