=== What is GitHub?
https://github.com/[GitHub] is a web-based hosting service that manages Git repositories. +

GitHub is not Git, although it is build on top of Git. Git is a distributed version control system used to manage projects while GitHub is an online service that stores the projects. +

GitHub is one of the most popular hosting platforms for version control, but there are others including https://gitlab.com/[GitLab] and https://bitbucket.org/[Bitbucket]. +

`wg_WGFAST` is a GitHub repository within the https://github.com/ices-eg[ICES Expert Groups] workspace. +

To contribute to the WGFAST convention documents, you will have to create a free GitHub account. +

=== Create a GitHub account
1. Go to https://github.com and create an account.
2. Select the Free plan.
3. Answer the questions GitHub askes about what you do. Or, skip this step.
4. Verify your email address.
5. Create your first repository!
 - Add a repository name and short description.
 - Keep the repository public.
 - Initialize the repository with a README. These are initially written in Markdown and are a great way to tell people what your repository (project) is about.
 - Add a .gitignore file if there are files in your repository you want Git to ignore.
6. Read through https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/[Hello World guide]. It is a good tutorial to get you started. +


== Jargon
There are a few terms you should be familiar with before jumping into the deep end of Git and GitHub.

* *_Git_* - A type of version control system (software).
* *_GitHub_* - An online (in the cloud) hosting service for Git repositories. It is built on Git so a lot of the terminology will be the same between Git and GitHub.
* *_Repository_* - Also called a "repo". A repository is a folder for your project. It contains all the project documents. Repos can have code file and scripts from any language, pictures, videos, text files (.doc, .docx, .adoc, .txt, .mb etc.), PDFs, etc.. If a file is part of a project, it goes in the repo.
* *_Clone_* (n.) / *_Cloning a repo_* (v.) - A cloned repository is a complete copy of a repository. You usually clone a repository from GitHub (hosting service) to your local machine to work on project files locally.
* *_Fork_* (n.) / *_Forking a repo_* (v.) - This is a special term used by GitHub and a few other hosting services. A fork is a cloned repository owned by someone else that you manage in your GitHub account. "Forking a repo" means to clone someone else's repository to your account. You are going to fork a copy of the `ices-eg/wg_WGFAST` repository to your own account to work on it independently before submitting any changes back to `ices-eg/wg_WGFAST`. `ices-eg` (ICES Expert Groups) is the team that owns the workspace. `wg_WGFAST` is the repository (project space) for the FAST working group.
* *_Upstream repository_* - The repository you forked from.
* *_Remote repository_* - The repository on GitHub or another hosting service.
* *_Branch_* - Branches of a repository are isolated development areas. You create a branch to work on part of a project without affecting the entire project. Every repository has one default branch, usually called `master`, and can have multiple other branches. You merge branches using a pull request.
* *_Add_* or *_Stage_* - Staging is the step before committing a file to a repository. It is area between your working directory and your repository. You can continue to edit files that have been staged.
* *_Commit_* - "Checking in" a file. Committing a file takes all the changes in the staging area and moves them to the repository.
* *_Push_* - Move changes (commits) from your local machine to a remote repository.
* *_Fetch_* - Retrieve changes from a remote repository without merging the changes into your own branch.
* *_Merge_* - Integrate the contents of the source branch into another branch.
* *_Pull_* - Fetch and merge in one step.
* *_Pull Request_* - Also called a "PR". A pull request tells others about the changes you have made (all the commits) to the project. It is called a pull request because you are asking to pull the changes from a source to a target. You can create a pull request between branches of a single repository or between branches of different repositories. +
