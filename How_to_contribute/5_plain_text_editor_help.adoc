These instructions are to help contributors install and use either Atom or Brackets to edit WGFAST convention documents.

== Why use a text editor?
There are three ways you can view and edit AsciiDoc documents. +

. Install the Asciidoctor toolchain and all its dependencies to create backends (PDF, HTML, ePubs, Word docs, etc.). Requires https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/[Ruby]. You cannot see live updates as you edit.
. Install AsciiDoc browser extensions in Chrome, Firefox, or Opera and open files in your browser. Preview only. To see live updates you will have to install and set up a system monitor to watch for file changes.
. Use a modern text editor/IDE that supports live preview and syntax highlighting of AsciiDoc documents. Syntax highlighting helps differentiate between markup commands and text.

*Answer*: Installing and using a modern text editor/IDE is the easiest option to edit and preview AsciiDoc documents across multiple platforms!

AsciidocFX is supported on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

=== Installing AsciidocFX
The easiest way to install AsciidocFX is to go to the installation section of the AsciidocFX website and download the installer for your system and run it.

=== Integration with Git and GitHub
There is no Git/GitHub GUI, but there is a terminal emulator. This means that while working in AsciidocFX, you can open the terminal emulator and run Git commands. The terminal will open in the directory you are in.

To change what terminal is used, update the settings in `Settings -> Terminal Settings` tab (left side of the screen).

TIP: Windows users, you might want to change the path from the Window's command prompt to the path for Git Bash. The path to Git Bash will depend on where you installed Git. The path to Git Bash under a default installation would be: `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe`

Note: The default editor theme has a white background. You can change the theme to "Dark" in `Settings -> Editor Settings` tab.

== https://atom.io/[Atom]

Atom is supported on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

=== Installing Atom
Click the big, yellow Download button at https://atom.io/[Atom.io]. If the operating system listed above the Download button is not your operating system, you can find other builds and releases at https://github.com/atom/atom (scroll down).

==== Packages
To preview AsciiDoc documents you will have to install a few packages.

* asciidoc-assistant +
 Installs the following packages.
** asciidoc-image-helper +
 Provides the ability to past images from the clipboard.
** asciidoc-preview +
 Shows an HTML preview for the AsciiDoc content in the current editor.
** autocomplete-asciidoc +
 AsciiDoc language autocompletions.
** language-asciidoc +
 Syntax highlighting and snippets for AsciiDoc.

* Other packages you might want.
** markdown-preview-plus +
 To show and HTML preview of Markdown (`.md`) documents.
** terminal-tab +
 To use a Git terminal from within Atom. This package is a little flaky - closing the terminal within the editor crashes Atom.

=== Integration with Git and GitHub

==== Staging and commits
1. In the Git panel, right-click on the file and choose `Stage`. +
2. Enter a useful commit message to let people know what changes you made, and click `Commit to master`. +

- To enable the AsciiDoc Preview and Git extensions you have to select the respective icons on the right. The AsciiDoc preview icon will only show up if an `.adoc` file is selected.
- The live preview pane can be un-docked if you do not like its default location on the bottom of the screen.


== Pro, Cons, Quirks
.Windows only
Various parts of the "How-to" documents were written using the three text editors/IDEs on a Dell XPS 15 (9560) with Microsoft Windows 10 Pro Build 18363, 32 GB RAM. +

If anyone wants to update this section for macOS and Linux, please do!
