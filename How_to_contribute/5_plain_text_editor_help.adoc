These instructions are to help contributors install and use either Atom or Brackets to edit WGFAST convention documents.

== Why use a text editor/IDE?
There are three ways you can view and edit AsciiDoc documents. +

. Install the Asciidoctor toolchain and all its dependencies to create backends (PDF, HTML, ePubs, Word docs, etc.). Requires https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/[Ruby]. You cannot see updates as you edit.
. Install AsciiDoc browser extensions in Chrome, Firefox, or Opera and open files in your browser. Preview only. To see live updates you will have to install and set up a system monitor to watch for file changes.
. Use a modern text editor/IDE that supports live preview and syntax highlighting of AsciiDoc documents. Syntax highlighting helps differentiate between markup commands and text.

*Answer*: Installing and using a modern text editor/IDE is the easiest option to edit and preview AsciiDoc documents across multiple platforms!

CAUTION: This document is not going to give you all the tips and tricks for each editor/IDE. It is only meant to help you choose an editor/IDE and get started. Please refer to the manuals and online community help sections for in depth information on each program.

image:AsciidocFX_logo.png[width = 45, height = 45] +
AsciidocFX is supported on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

=== Installing AsciidocFX
The easiest way to install AsciidocFX is to go to the installation section of the AsciidocFX website, download the installer for your system and run it.

https://www.asciidocfx.com/#truehow-to-install-asciidocfx[How to Install AsciidocFX]

=== Integration with Git and GitHub
There is no Git/GitHub GUI, but there is a terminal emulator. This means that while working in AsciidocFX, you can open the terminal emulator and run Git commands. The terminal emulator will open in your current working directory.

To change what terminal is used, update the settings in the `Settings -> Terminal Settings` tab (left side of the screen).

TIP: Windows users, you might want to change the path from the Window's command prompt to the path for Git Bash. The path to Git Bash will depend on where you installed Git. The path to Git Bash under a default installation would be: `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe`

TIP: The default editor theme has a white background. You can change the theme to "Dark" in the `Settings -> Editor Settings` tab.

=== Installing Atom
Click the big, yellow Download button at https://atom.io/[Atom.io]. If the operating system listed above the Download button is not your operating system, you can find other builds and releases at https://github.com/atom/atom (scroll down). +

==== Packages
To preview AsciiDoc and Markdown documents you will have to install a few packages. +

From the Welcome Page you can click on `Install a Package` or go to `File -> Settings` and click on `Install` at the bottom of the list of options.

.Packages to install
* asciidoc-assistant +
 Installs the following packages.
** asciidoc-image-helper +

** autocomplete-asciidoc +
 AsciiDoc language autocompletions.
** language-asciidoc +
 Syntax highlighting and snippets for AsciiDoc.

* Other packages you might want.
** markdown-preview-plus +
 To show an HTML preview of Markdown (`.md`) documents.
** atom-terminal +

NOTE: If asciidoc-assistant failed to install autocomplete-asciidoc. You might have to install that package separately.

==== Useful shortcuts

=== Integration with Git and GitHub
Atom comes bundled with a GUI for Git and GitHub. You have to supply your GitHub login credentials the first time push to GitHub. If you want to work in a terminal, you have to install an external package. We suggest installing an external terminal package and working in the terminal to start. This will help you get familiar the underlying Git functions.

There are a number of Atom packages that give you access to a terminal from within Atom. The simplest is `atom-terminal` which is sets a pointer to your external terminal.  `terminal-tab` opens a terminal within Atom, but can be a little flaky in that closing the terminal crashes Atom.

Instructions for working in a Git terminal are in the link:2_suggested_workflow.adoc[Suggested workflow to contribute to the ICES WGFAST convention documents] file.

==== Git terminal from within Atom
If you installed terminal-tab or


==== Staging and commits from within Atom
1. Open the Git panel, right-click on the file and choose `Stage`. +
2. Enter a useful commit message to let people know what changes you made, and click `Commit to master`. +

== Pro, Cons, Quirks
.Windows only
Various parts of the "How-to" documents were written using the three text editors/IDEs on a Dell XPS 15 (9560) with Microsoft Windows 10 Pro Build 18363, 32 GB RAM. +

If anyone wants to update this section for macOS and Linux, please do!
