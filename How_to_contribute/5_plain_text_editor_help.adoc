These instructions are to help contributors install and use either Atom or Brackets to edit WGFAST convention documents.

== Why use a text editor?
There are three ways you can view and edit AsciiDoc documents. +

. Install the Asciidoctor toolchain and all its dependencies to create backends (PDF, HTML, ePubs, Word docs, etc.). Requires https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/[Ruby]. You cannot see live updates as you edit.
. Install AsciiDoc browser extensions in Chrome, Firefox, or Opera and open files in your browser. Preview only. To see live updates you will have to install and set up a system monitor to watch for file changes.
. Use a modern text editor/IDE that supports live preview and syntax highlighting of AsciiDoc documents. Syntax highlighting helps differentiate between markup commands and text.

*Answer*: Installing and using a modern text editor/IDE is the easiest option to edit and preview AsciiDoc documents across multiple platforms!

AsciidocFX is supported on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

=== Installing AsciidocFX
The easiest way to install AsciidocFX is to go to the installation section of the AsciidocFX website and download the installer for your system.

=== Integration with Git and GitHub
There is no Git/GitHub GUI, but there is a terminal emulator. This means that while working in AsciidocFX, you can open the terminal emulator and run Git commands. The terminal will open in the directory you are in.

To change what terminal is used, update the settings in `Settings -> Terminal Settings` tab (left side of the screen).

TIP: Windows users, you might want to change the path from the Window's command prompt to the path for Git Bash. The path to Git Bash will depend on where you installed Git. The path to Git Bash under a default installation would be: `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe`

=== Panes

Note: The default editor theme has a white background. You can change the theme to "Dark" in `Settings -> Editor Settings` tab.

== https://atom.io/[Atom]
image:atom-logo.svg[width = 50, height = 50] +
Atom is supported on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

=== Installing Atom
Click the big, yellow Download button at https://atom.io/[Atom.io]. If the operating system listed above the Download button is not your operating system, you can find other builds and releases at https://github.com/atom/atom (scroll down).

==== Packages
ctrl-shift-a or cmd-shift-a.
Synchronize the preview pane: synchronize the preview pane with the AsciiDoc source pane.
WARNING: The scroll position on the preview pane does not automatically scroll the AsciiDoc source pane.

=== Integration with Git and GitHub

==== Staging and commits
1. In the Git panel, right-click on the file and choose `Stage`. +
2. Enter a useful commit message to let people know what changes you made, and click `Commit to master`. +

Brackets is supported on macOS, Windows, and Linux

=== Install Brackets

==== Extensions

=== Integration with Git and GitHub

Note - if you have two-factor authentication on GH, you cannot use the git-easy thing. You'll have to push in the Git terminal.

Adding brackets-git

Cloning in Brackets

Not sure is Brackets works well on Windows machines.
The terminal in Atom seems to be a little flaky. Atom crashes when I close the terminal. Now going to try pushing in GitHub desktop (still editing in Atom).


_Atom_ is a text editor that works directly with GitHub upon installation. You as of this writing, you will still need to use Git to update your forked repository but other commands can be done within the Atom environment. You will have to install a few packages written for Atom to work with AsciiDoc documents. +
- _Brackets_ is a text editor that also works with Git and GitHub. You have to have Git installed, and you will have to install a few packages to preview AsciiDoc documents. +


Git is a great tool, but it has a steep learning curve. *You do not need to install Git and learn the command line version to contribute to the WGFAST convention documents.* +

Git comes bundled with the Atom text editor, which is easier to install and interface with GitHub than the command line version. Atom also allows two-factor authentication in GitHub which some government agencies might require. +

where an I typing???
where am I typing now???


If you're note a programmer - asciidocFX is proabaly the best beause is also gives you a style sheet. but you have to use all git commond (so what. suck it up)
Brackets is good because is shows you math equations. 2-factor authen is messed up.
Atom is good if you can't handle Git. Quick and easy integration with GitHub.

== Pro, Cons, Quirks
=== Windows only
Various parts of the "How-to" documents were written using the three text editors/IDEs on a Dell XPS 15 (9560) with Micorsoft Windows 10 Pro Build 18363, 32 GB RAM. +

If anyone wants to update this section for MacOS and Linux, please do!
