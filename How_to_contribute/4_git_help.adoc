=== What is Git?
https://git-scm.com/[Git] is a free and open source distributed version control system for working on group projects. Originally designed for developers to work collaboratively on large software projects, Git has been repurposed by many scientific communities to manage the evolution of projects in a structured and reproducible way.

With Git, all files related to a project (images, documents, code, etc.) and their change histories are stored in a single repository. Repositories support a hierarchical directory structure, meaning folders and subfolders are allowed. The WGFAST repository is hosted on GitHub in the ICES-eg workspace.

The power of Git comes from its distributed version control system (DVCS). Unlike local and centralized version control systems, in DVCSs users (clients - you) are able to fully mirror all files and folders in the project (repository) and see the project's full history from all users. Think of DVCS as the Track Changes feature in Microsoft Word on steroids.

We are only going to use a few core commands in Git, but if you want to dive deeper into Git and DVCSs, there are many tutorials online, including https://git-scm.com/doc[vidoes, books, and external links] on the Git website. The _Getting Started_ and _Git Basics_ chapters from the https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2[Pro Git] book (free online) is also a good place to start. +

=== Download Git
Download Git from the Git website. link:https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git Download] +

=== Install Git
How you install Git depends on your operating system.

==== Linux

==== MacOS

=== Configure Git
The first time you start Git on your computer you have to https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup[configure your Git environment]. +

Git comes with a `git config` tool that lets you control the configuration variables to:

* Setup your user name and email address. Git uses this information to uniquely identify you in your commits. +
* Assign your text editor. +
{empty} +

You can view all your settings and where they come from using:
----
$ git congif --list --show-origin
----

You will probably have to hit `Enter` or the space bar to scroll through the list if your terminal is not large enough to see all the output on one screen. Type `q` to exit once you are at the end of the list.

If the output looks like a lot of gobbledygook to you, try:

----
$ git config -l
----

Again, you might have to hit `Enter` or the space bar to scroll through the list. Type `q` to exit when you are at the end of the list.


==== You! (Your idenity)
*These settings have to be set for you to interact with GitHub.*
(It is in bold - pay attention!)

1. Set a user name.
2. Set your email.
----
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
----

WARNING: Your Git username and GitHub username do not have to match. *Your Git user email has to be linked to your GitHub account*.

=== Terminology
The https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary[Git Glossary] +
This is the technical glossary of all Git terms and commands. +

These are a few terms you should be familiar with before jumping into the deep end of Git and GitHub.

* *_Git_* - A type of version control system (software).
* *_GitHub_* - An online (in the cloud) hosting service for Git repositories. 
* *_Repository_* - Also called a "repo". A repository tracks all changes made to files in a project over time. Initializing a repository for a project creates a `.git` folder that stores the project's history. If you delete the `.git` folder, you delete the project's history.
* *_Clone_* (n.) / *_Cloning a repo_* (v.) - A cloned repository is a complete copy of a repository. You usually clone a repository from GitHub (hosting service) to your local machine to work on project files locally.
* *_Fork_* (n.) / *_Forking a repo_* (v.) - This is a special term used by GitHub and a few other hosting services. It is not a Git command. A fork is a cloned repository owned by someone else that you manage in your GitHub account. "Forking a repo" means to clone someone else's repository to your account. You are going to fork a copy of the `ices-eg/wg_WGFAST` repository to your own account to work on it independently before submitting any changes back to `ices-eg/wg_WGFAST`. `ices-eg` (ICES Expert Groups) is the team that owns the workspace. `wg_WGFAST` is the repository (project space) for the FAST working group.
* *_Upstream repository_* - The repository you fork from.
* *_Remote repository_* - A repository on GitHub or another hosting service.
* *_Branch_* - Branches of a repository are isolated development areas. You create a branch to work on part of a project without affecting the entire project. Every repository has one default branch, usually called `master`, and can have multiple other branches. You merge branches using a pull request.
* *_Add_* or *_Stage_* - Staging is the step before committing a file to a repository. It is area between your working directory and your repository. You can continue to edit files that have been staged.
* *_Commit_* - "Checking in" a file. Committing a file takes all the changes in the staging area and moves them to the repository.
* *_Push_* - Move changes (commits) from your local machine to a remote repository.
* *_Fetch_* - Retrieve changes from a remote repository without merging the changes into your own branch.
* *_Merge_* - Integrate the contents of the source branch into another branch.
* *_Pull_* - Fetch and merge in one step.
* *_Pull Request_* - Also called a "PR". A pull request tells others about the changes you have made (all the commits) to the project. It is called a pull request because you are asking to pull the changes from a source to a target. You can create a pull request between branches of a single repository or between branches of different repositories. +
